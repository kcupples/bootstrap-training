		<p> Given a chance, a reptile is going to eat  you.  No matter where you are in the world, there are reptiles waiting to strike.  If you let your guard down for a single second, you could get bitten.  In the case of a small reptile, you might just be poisoned. In the case of an Anaconda or a Boa Constrictor, you are a gonner. Not even bones will remain. </p>

						<p> <strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong> was walking down Santa Monica Boulavard when 3 foot Diamondback Rattlesnake attacked:<blockquote><p>The rattler was hiding in an alley When I walked past the alley, the rattler grabbed my leg and started biting.... I've never been so scared!</p> <footer>Sarah Jessica Parker</footer></blockquote> Mrs. Parker was lucky.  Although bitten, this specific snake had already attacked that day and had not accumulated enough venom to be lethal. Mrs. Parker only needed minor treatment, including several stitches. Anti-venom was not required. </p>
					</li>
						<li>
						<p> <strong>Robert Griffin III</strong> <small>(RGIII)</small> was swimming in Lake Erie, in Cleveland when 6 foot Water Moccasin attacked.  Robert was not as lucky as Mrs. Parker:<blockquote><p>The cottonmouth's venom went to work instantly, disolving the Cleveland Brown Quarterback's flesh to the bone. The only thing that remained was his surgically repaired knee, which we recovered and mailed to his next of kin via FedEx ground shipping.</p> <footer>Deputy John Riggins, Cleveland Police Department</footer></blockquote> People must be especially careful when intruding in snake's natural habitats.  Attacks in the water and in remote regions are almost always deadly. </p>

				<p> In order to take full advantage of this framework, you need to understand three key concepts, containers, rows, and columns. We'll take a look at containers in this video. Now a Bootstrap container is declared through a special class that allows you to control the layout. Now adding this class is also going to create 15 pixels of padding on each side of the element. So the content within a layout never fully reaches the edge of the screen. So any time you want an element to go the full width of the browser, you don't put it inside a container class. </p>
