		<p> In order to take full advantage of this framework, you need to understand three key concepts, containers, rows, and columns. We'll take a look at containers in this video. Now a Bootstrap container is declared through a special class that allows you to control the layout. Now adding this class is also going to create 15 pixels of padding on each side of the element. So the content within a layout never fully reaches the edge of the screen. So any time you want an element to go the full width of the browser, you don't put it inside a container class. </p>
